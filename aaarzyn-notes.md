- [X] test playground of information retrieval for testing
- [X] agent to agent schema
    - [X] need agent from, agent to, context sent, context received, handoff id
    - [X] add timestamp, task id, pipeline, etc.
    - [X] add eval scores as doc (figure out evaluation metrics)
- [ ] mongodb connection for backend of metrics
    - [ ] connect to database
    - [ ] create contextscope handoffs collection
    - [ ] create contextscope metrics section for results
- [ ] create vector setup for embeddings
    - [ ] need to figure out the steps here
- [ ] metrics calcs
    - [ ] determine what calculations
        - [ ] determine drift
        - [ ] determine compression
- [ ] handoff logging 
    - [ ] agent output as next input
    - [ ] embeddings live
    - [ ] store immediately
- [ ] metric computation trigger 
    - [ ] do with each hand off
    - [ ] update evals scores and eval dash

- [ ] make agg pipeline
- [ ] make summary stats
