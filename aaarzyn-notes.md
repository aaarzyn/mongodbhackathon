- [X] test playground of information retrieval for testing
- [X] agent to agent schema
    - [X] need agent from, agent to, context sent, context received, handoff id
    - [X] add timestamp, task id, pipeline, etc.
    - [X] add eval scores as doc (figure out evaluation metrics)
- [X] mongodb connection for backend of metrics
    - [X] connect to database
    - [X] create eval_handoffs collection (renamed from "handoffs")
    - [X] create eval_pipelines collection (renamed from "pipeline_results")
- [ ] create vector setup for embeddings
    - [ ] need to figure out the steps here
- [X] metrics calcs
    - [X] determine what calculations
        - [X] determine drift
        - [X] determine compression
- [ ] handoff logging 
    - [X] agent output as next input
    - [ ] embeddings live
    - [ ] store immediately
- [ ] metric computation trigger 
    - [ ] do with each hand off
    - [ ] update evals scores and eval dash

- [X] make agg pipeline
- [X] make summary stats
