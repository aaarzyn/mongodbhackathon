# ContextScope Eval - Development Progress

## 2025-10-11 - Evaluation Schema and Metrics

Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-11 20:19:36Z

Summary
- Added evaluation data models and metric utilities focused solely on ContextScope evaluations per PROJECT.md.

Completed Tasks
- Implemented `backend/evaluator/schema.py` with Pydantic models:
  - `VectorBundle`, `EvalScores`, `HandoffEvaluation`, `PipelineScore`, `PipelineEvaluation`.
  - Added `EvaluationSchemaError` with validation for embeddings and normalized score ranges.
- Implemented `backend/evaluator/metrics.py` with core metrics:
  - `compute_fidelity` (embeddings cosine or TF fallback),
  - `compute_relevance_drift` (blend of 1-fidelity and top-term divergence),
  - `compute_compression_efficiency`,
  - `compute_temporal_coherence` (date/year preservation),
  - `compute_response_utility` (relative/absolute),
  - `evaluate_handoff` helper for streamlined scoring.
- All functions include type hints, docstrings, and specific exceptions.

Notes
- Designed to operate without network access by accepting precomputed vectors and using lightweight text fallbacks.
- Ready to be wired into agent pipeline and MongoDB persistence for eval runs.

## 2025-10-11 - Judge Provider, Aggregations, and Eval Service

Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-11 20:25:16Z

Summary
- Added Fireworks judge provider stub, aggregation and persistence utilities, deterministic key-info extraction, and a high-level evaluator service.

Completed Tasks
- Provider: `backend/providers/fireworks.py` with OpenAI-compatible chat call using `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and default model `gpt-oss-20b`.
- Aggregations: `backend/db/aggregation.py` with insert/get helpers, rollup by format, and pipeline rollup using geometric mean for end-to-end fidelity.
- Extraction: `backend/evaluator/extract.py` for deterministic key unit extraction from JSON/text and preservation checks.
- Service: `backend/evaluator/service.py` to compute metrics, extract key info, and persist handoff and pipeline evaluations.
- Config: Added Fireworks fields to `backend/config.py`.

Notes
- Chosen collections: `eval_handoffs`, `eval_pipelines`.
- `HandoffEvaluation` now includes optional `pipeline_id` for grouping.
- Token counts use a deterministic whitespace heuristic by default.


## 2025-10-11 - Unit Tests for Evaluations

Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-11 20:31:20Z

Summary
- Added unit tests covering metrics, extraction, and schemas. Tests avoid network and DB dependencies.

Completed Tasks
- `tests/unit/test_metrics.py`: fidelity, drift, compression, temporal coherence, response utility, and `evaluate_handoff` tuple contract.
- `tests/unit/test_extract.py`: JSON-key extraction and key-info preservation checks.
- `tests/unit/test_schema.py`: score range validation, vector bundle validation, and minimal handoff model construction.

Notes
- Tests are offline and deterministic; they do not require pymongo installation.

## 2025-10-11 - Config Env Var Tests

Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-11 20:35:13Z

Summary
- Added tests to validate environment-based configuration for Fireworks and Mongo connection string.

Completed Tasks
- `tests/unit/test_env_config.py`: Ensures `Settings` reads `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and falls back to `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING` when `MONGO_URI` is absent; verifies `FireworksJudge.available()` reflects API key presence.

Notes
- Tests do not perform any network or DB connections and avoid touching `MongoDBClient` initialization.

## 2025-10-11 - Live Fireworks and MongoDB Checks

Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-11 20:38:23Z

Summary
- Verified Fireworks GPT-OSS-20b chat completion and MongoDB Atlas connectivity using values from .env. Fixed config to accept alternate Mongo env vars via validation alias.

Completed Tasks
- Ran a live Fireworks chat call via `backend/providers/fireworks.py` (OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Call succeeded.
- Connected to MongoDB Atlas using `MongoDBClient` and confirmed ping and collection listing.
- Updated `backend/config.py` to use `validation_alias` for `mongo_uri` (supports `MONGO_URI`, `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING`, `MONGODB_URI`).

Notes
- Fireworks sample response was blank but call returned successfully (HTTP and parsing OK). Model/temperature limits likely returned minimal text.

## 2025-10-11 - Ran Evals on Mflix Data

Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-11 20:42:50Z

Summary
- Created a Python venv, installed minimal deps, and executed `backend.agent_simulator` to generate and persist evaluation handoffs for two pipelines (JSON and Markdown) using live Mflix data. Verified documents in Mongo.

Completed Tasks
- Added INFO logs in `backend/agent_simulator.py` to print pipeline IDs.
- Created `.venv` and installed: pydantic(+email), pydantic-settings, pymongo, python-dotenv, numpy.
- Ran two pipelines; confirmed inserts:
  - `eval_handoffs` count now > 0 (observed 12)
  - `eval_pipelines` count now > 0 (observed 4)
- Example recent pipeline IDs and scores:
  - `json-681adb87`: avg_fidelity=1.0, avg_drift=0.0, total_compression=0.0, end_to_end_fidelity=1.0
  - `md-6269e21a`: avg_fidelity=1.0, avg_drift=0.0, total_compression=0.0, end_to_end_fidelity=1.0

Notes
- Current demo contexts are identical across handoffs, yielding perfect fidelity and zero drift. We can introduce controlled perturbations or compression to produce more realistic scores if desired.

## 2025-10-11 - Batch Evals with Fireworks Judge

Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-11 20:51:53Z

Summary
- Added a batch mode to the simulator and executed 10 pipeline pairs (JSON + Markdown), with Fireworks-based judging per handoff to drive visible model consumption.

Completed Tasks
- `backend/agent_simulator.py`: Added `--batch N` flag; varied user/movie selection to diversify contexts; ensured `use_llm_judge=True` for all handoffs.
- Ran `--batch 10` in `.venv` successfully. Inserted additional evals and rollups.
- Post-run DB snapshot:
  - `eval_handoffs` count: 138
  - `eval_pipelines` count: 46
  - Recent examples: `json-b9-1b144c`, `md-b9-4985f6` (perfect fidelity/drift given current synthetic contexts).

Notes
- Scores remain perfect due to intentionally identical context propagation; next iteration can add loss/compression/noise to reflect realistic drift and compression effects.





## 2024-10-11 - Initial Project Setup and MongoDB Atlas Connection

### Summary
Successfully set up the foundational backend infrastructure for the ContextScope Eval movie recommendation system with MongoDB Atlas integration.

### Completed Tasks

#### 2. MongoDB Atlas Connection
- Implemented `MongoDBClient` class with:
  - Connection pooling (50 max, 10 min connections)
  - Comprehensive error handling (ConnectionFailure, ServerSelectionTimeout, etc.)
  - Context manager pattern for safe database operations
  - Singleton pattern for global client access
- Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas cluster: `cluster0.kkpr6k.mongodb.net`

  - UserPreferences for recommendation system
- **Movie Model** (`backend/models/movie.py`):
  - Complete movie metadata (title, year, runtime, cast, directors, genres)
  - IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings
  - Plot embeddings for vector search support
- **MovieComment Model**: User reviews and ratings
- All models include proper validation and type hints

#### 4. Service Layer
- Implemented `MflixService` with comprehensive query methods:
  - User queries: `get_user_by_email()`, `list_users()`
  - Movie queries: 
    - `get_top_rated_movies()` - Filter by rating and votes

  - `clean_empty_values()` - Handles data quality issues (empty strings → None)
  - Recursive document cleaning for nested structures

#### 6. Testing Infrastructure
- Built comprehensive `test_connection.py` script that verifies:
  - MongoDB Atlas connection
